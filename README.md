# Python-Data-structures-and-Algorithms

This repository is used to document my learning of Data Structures and Algorithms with Python. I shall be documenting as I go through this topic in class for the period of an entire semester running from January 2022 to April 2022.

The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources. 

This may not cover everything under the topic but will benefit my learning and understanding as well.

I may have created this repository much later in the semester but I shall try to include every topic we have covered.

This unit may also include some mathematics especially Discrete Structures and Discrete Mathematics among others.
